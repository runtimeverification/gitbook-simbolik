# Getting started

Simbolik is still in the early development phase. This guide walks you through the necessary steps to gain access to the beta version.

### TL;DR

* [Install Foundry](getting-started.md#install-foundry)
* [Get a free API key](getting-started.md#get-a-free-api-key)
* [Install the Simbolik VSCode extension](getting-started.md#installing-the-vscode-extension)
* [Configure your API key in the extension settings](getting-started.md#configure-your-api-key-in-the-extension-settings)

### Install Foundry

Simbolik depends on Foundry to compile your smart contracts.

Please follow the [official installation instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to setup Foundry on your system.

### Get a free API key

The beta version requires a free API key. You can get it by logging into our [website](https://simbolik.runtimeverification.com/) using either GitHub, Google, or MetaMask as an authentication provider.
